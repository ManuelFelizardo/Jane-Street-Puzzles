 Jane Street Puzzle Solutions

## Overview
As a fun hobby, I enjoy solving some brain teasers, such as the monthly puzzle by Jane Street.
My approach to solving these tends to vary with the puzzle itself, from exploratory approaches to cryptic puzzles (https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/many-happy-returns-index/), to simply modeling and solving a mathematical problem (https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/robot-capture-the-flag-index), but a lot of times my solution will be code-based.
In this repository, I will post the solutions to the problems I solve with a code-based approach. I will try to include a brief explanation of my approach as well.
